/**
 * Return up to 10 photos worth of extended information, near the current
 * location of the user and his preferred regions.
 *
 *
 * @param limit: constrain the number of photos that are returned to the
 *     specified number.  Maximum value is ``10``.  The default value is
 *     ``10``.
 *
 * @param locale: the locale in which the photograph's caption is written.
 *     A locale corresponds to a tag respecting RFC 4646, which is a set
 *     of parameters that defines a language, country and any special
 *     variant references.  A locale identifier consists of at least a
 *     language identifier and a region identifier, i.e., a ISO 639-3
 *     alpha-3 code element, optionally followed by a dash character ``-``
 *     and a ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. For example: ``eng`` (which denotes
 *     a standard English), ``eng-US`` (which denotes an American English).
 *
 * @param location: a tuple-like (array) `[longitude, latitude]`
 *     representing the user's current geographical location.
 *
 * @param offset: require to skip that many photos before beginning to
 *     return them to the client.  If both ``limit`` and ``offset`` are
 *     specified, then ``offset`` postcards are skipped before starting
 *     to count the ``limit`` postcards that are returned.  The default
 *     value is ``0``.
 *
 * @param radius: maximum distance between the known location of the
 *     photos to return and the specified location.  If no location has
 *     been specified, the platform uses the IP address of the client
 *     application that sends this request to determine the location of
 *     the user.
 *
 *     The maximum supported radius is currently 100,000 meters.  If the
 *     specified radius is larger, it will be automatically shortened to
 *     the appropriate limit.  The default value is 5,000 meters.
 *
 * @param sync_time: indicate the earliest time to return photos based on
 *     the time they have been published.  If not specified, the platform
 *     returns photos sorted by the ascending order of their publication
 *     time.
 *
 *
 * @return: a ``Promise`` object representing the eventual completion (or
 *     failure) of the asynchronous request.  If the request passed, the
 *     promise returns a list of photo identifications.
